Computer for Low Income Families
Computer for Low Income Families

WHAT IS IT? 
Hello everybody, I'm a  Computer Science graduate , I have an idea to 
develop a computer kit for low income families , which helps poor childern to learn ,explore their ideas within no cost. 

WHY? 
The goal is to connect poor childerns  to internet , so that they can learn the technology may become helping hands in science and technology.

HOW? 
The kit will consist of a central processing ( raspberry pi ) and other  components ( small display,ports,wifi connection,bluetooth,cd/dvd ) idea = innovation. 
The physical connection between components and the central processing will be default , in other words, the child simply will connect the central processing component 
and specify in the software, the component which was connected to a specific port . 
The central processing will provide a good computing capacity ,processor speed , user friendly to the childerns perspective . 

COST? 
The kit will not have any profit, in other words , each kit will be sold just to pay the costs manufacturing, as the idea is to include our poor families to the era of internet ,to be a part of our innovation to a brighter future. 

FUTURE PLANS? 
1 ) To connect poor childern ideas to build brighter future . 
2 ) Firm a partnership with an organization, government or company so the cost of the platform is low enough to be distributed in public schools in deprived areas .
